            "content": "Turing, as you know, is the world's first ray-tracing GPU. And it completes our new computer graphics platform, which is going to reinvent computer graphics altogether. It unites four different computing modes rasterization, accelerated ray-tracing, computing with CUDA, and artificial intelligence. It uses these four basic methods to create imagery for the future. There's two different -- two major ways that we'll experience the benefits right-away. The first is for the markets of visualization today, they require photorealistic images. Whether it's a IKEA Catalog or movie, or architectural engineering, or product design, car design, all of these types of markets require photorealistic images. And the only way to really achieve that is to use ray-tracing with physically based materials and lighting."

And this platform has those four computation methods that I described, for generating images. We put that platform out with the support of Microsoft. They call it the Microsoft DirectX Raytracing. And the major game engine companies, Epic has implemented real-time ray-tracing and the RTX into, the Unreal Engine. And at GDC and GTC, we demonstrated for the very first time on four Volta GPUs, on four Volta GPUs, the ability to do that. And it was the intention of - to get this platform out to all of the game developers."

            "content": "On the channel inventory side, we see inventory in the lower end of our stack. And that inventory is well-positioned for back-to-school and the building season that's coming up on Q3. And so, I feel pretty good about that. The rest of our product launches and the ramp-up of Turing is going really well. And so, I think the rest of the announcements we haven't made, but stay tuned. The RTX family is going to be a real game-changer for us."

            "content": "Pascal was really successful. Pascal, relative to Maxwell, was a leap in fact, and it was a really significant upgrade. The architectures were largely the same. They were both programmable shading. They were both at the same generation programmable shading. But Pascal was much, much more energy efficient, I think it was something like 30%, 40% more energy efficient than Maxwell. And that translated to performance benefits to customers. The success of Pascal was fantastic. There's just simply no comparison to Turing. Turing is a reinvention of computer graphics."

            "content": "In the transportation industry, let's take one particular vertical, there are two dynamics that are happening that are very, very abundantly clear, and that will double -- transform that industry. The first of course is ride hailing and ride sharing. Those platforms in order to make a recommendation of which taxi to bring to which passenger, which customer, is a really large computing problem. It's a machine learning problem; it's an optimization problem at very, very large scale. The second is self-driving cars. Every single car company that's working on robot taxis or self-driving cars, needs to collect data, label data, train on your network, or train a whole bunch of on your networks, and run those neural networks and cars."

It is not the largest segment, but I believe it's going to be a very large segment of our Datacenter business. There're 30 million servers around the world, and that's kind of estimate, in the cloud, and there are a whole lot more in enterprises. I believe that almost every server in the future will be accelerated."

            "content": "A lot of gamers at night, they could -- while they're sleeping, they could do some mining. And so, do they buy it for mining or did they buy it for gaming, it's kind of hard to say. And some miners were unable to buy our OEM products, and so they jumped on to the market to buy it from retail, and that probably happened a great deal as well. And that all happened in the last -- the previous several quarters, probably starting from late Q3, Q4, Q1, and very little last quarter, and we're projecting no crypto-mining going forward."

And with respect to the next generation, it is the case that when we first started working on autonomous vehicles, they needed our help. And we used a three-year-old Pascal GPU for the current generation of autopilot computers. And it is very clear now that in order to have a safe autopilot system, we need a lot more computing horsepower."

Each of our platforms AI, Gaming, ProViz and self driving cars continued to enjoy great adoption. These markets are -- we are enabling are some of the most impactful to world -- to the world today. We launched Turing this week. It was 10 years in the making and completes the NVIDIA RTX platform. NVIDIA RTX with Turing is the greatest advance since CUDA, nearly a decade ago."

Turing is an extremely important piece of architecture, and as you know, it will be with us for some time. So, I think the inventory balance is getting ready for that. And don't forget, our work in terms of Datacenter and what we have for Volta is also a very, very complex computer in some cases in terms of what we have also in terms of there."

We believe we've reached a normal period, as we're looking forward to essentially no cryptocurrency as we move forward."

You are correct that our Datacenter results that we see is always a tremendous, unique mix every single quarter in terms of what we're seeing. But, there's still some underlying points of that that will likely continue. The growth in terms of use by the hyperscales, continued industry-by-industry coming on-board, essentially just because the needs of accelerated computing for the workloads and for the data that they have is so essential."

We probably possibly see that again in our Q3 guidance, the year-over-year growth across each and every one of those platforms. Of course, our OEM business will be down likely year-over-year, again just due to absence of those cryptocurrency in our forecast."

Can you size that for us?"

But, there's a larger base of medium to smaller cloud and hyperscale customers out there who don't have R&D scale. And I think that's where your HGX platform seems to be focused on. Can you just give us an update on the uptake of your first generation HGX-1 reference platform and the initial interest on HGX-2?"

And number two, since Tesla did talk about you on their call, I'm curious what your comments are about the development for Hardware 3 and their own efforts to move away from your DRIVE platform?"
