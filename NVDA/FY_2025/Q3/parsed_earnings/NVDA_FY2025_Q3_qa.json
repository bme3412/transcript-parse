As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we're learning, however, is that it's not enough that we've now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling. And one of the biggest events and one of the most exciting developments is Strawberry, ChatGPT o1, OpenAI's o1, which does inference time scaling, what's called test time scaling. The longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces and it considers approaches like chain of thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to reflect and so on and so forth and it's intuitively, it's a little bit like us doing thinking in our head before we answer a question."

          "topic": "AI Factories and Generative AI Momentum",
          "content": "Our hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference. And that's when AI has really succeeded, right. It's when every single company is doing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and forecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department and engineering, of course and coding, of course. And so we hope that every company is doing inference 24/7. And that there will be a whole new era of AI, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI, just those large language models understand the human language and how we the thinking process, if you will. Physical AI understands the physical world and it understands the meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not and what could happen and what won't and not only does it understand but it can predict and roll out a short future. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and robotics. And so that's fired up so many AI-native companies and robotics companies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about. And it's really the reason why we built Omniverse. Omniverse is so that we can enable these AIs to be created and learn in Omniverse and learn from synthetic data generation and reinforcement learning physics feedback instead of human feedback is now physics feedback. To have these capabilities, Omniverse was created so that we can enable physical AI. And so that the goal is to generate tokens. The goal is to inference and we're starting to see that growth happening."

          "topic": "Platform Innovation and Future Roadmap",
          "content": "The way to think through that, Vivek, is I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize a trillion dollars with the data centers. Those -- if you look at the world's data centers, the vast majority of it is built for a time when we wrote applications by hand and we ran them on CPUs. It's just not a sensible thing to do anymore. If you have -- if every company's CapEx, if they're ready to build a data center tomorrow, they ought to build it for a future of machine-learning and generative AI. Because they have plenty of old data centers. And so what's going to happen over the course of next X number of years, and let's assume that over the course of four years, the world's data centers could be modernized as we grow into IT. As you know, IT continues to grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. And let's say by 2030, the world's data centers for computing is, call it a couple of trillion dollars. And we have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center from coding to machine learning. That's number one. The second part of it is generative AI, and we're now producing a new type of capability that world has never known, a new market segment that the world has never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything. It's something that's completely brand new. It's in a lot of ways as when the iPhone came, it was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing anything. And so we're going to see more and more companies like that. And they're going to create and generate out of their services, essentially intelligence. Just like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And if the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of electricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And so I think that the fact that all three are scaling is actually very sensible based on what we are. And in the area of foundation model, now we have multimodality foundation models and the amount of petabytes of video that these foundation models are going to be trained on is incredible. And so my expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be scaling pre-training, post-training as well as inference time scaling and which is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute and we're going to have to drive as hard as we can to keep increasing the performance by X factors at a time so that we can continue to drive down the cost and continue to increase their revenues and get the AI revolution going."

          "content": "Yes. So Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So we believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp, in the next quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4. So let's say Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that. Additionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and the Blackwell starting of -- ramping in Q4. So hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in terms of on our gross margin. We provided gross margin for our Q3. We provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75%. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do believe we can do that 75% in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full-year also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75%. So we're going to see some slight difference possibly in Q4. Again, with our transitions and the different cost structures that we have on our new product introductions. However, I'm not in the same number that you are there. We don't have exactly guidance, but I do believe you're lower than where we are."

          "topic": "Sovereign AI Growth and Gaming Supply Constraints",
          "content": "So first starting in terms of sovereign AI, such an important part of growth, something that is really surfaced with the onset of generative AI and building models in the individual countries around the world. And we see a lot of them and we talked about a lot of them in the call today and the work that they are doing. So our sovereign AI and our pipeline going forward is still absolutely intact as those are working to build these foundational models in their own language, in their own culture, and working in terms of the enterprises within those countries. And I think you'll continue to see this be growth opportunities that you may see with our regional clouds that are being stored up and/or those that are focusing in terms of AI factories for many parts of the sovereign AI. This is areas where this is growing not only in terms of in Europe, but you're also seeing this in terms of growth in terms of -- in the Asia-Pac as well. Let me flip to your second question that you asked regarding gaming. So our gaming right now from a supply, we're busy trying to make sure that we can ramp all of our different products. And in this case, our gaming supply, given what we saw selling through was moving quite fast. Now the challenge that we have is how fast could we get that supply getting ready into the market for this quarter. Not to worry, I think we'll be back on track with more suppliers we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We're just going to be tight for this quarter."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Blackwell Ramp and Gross Margins",
          "content": "So first starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross margin and defined low. Low, of course, is below the mid, and let's say we might be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%, we're going to be in that range. We could be higher than that as well. We're just going to have to see how it comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and continuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the improvement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year. So we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point. The second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our Hopper doing. We have seen substantial growth for our H200, not only in terms of orders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that up. It is an amazing product and it's the fastest-growing and ramping that we've seen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for sure, that is across-the-board in terms of all of our different configurations and our configurations include what we may do in terms of China. But keep that in mind that folks are also at the same time looking to build out their Blackwell. So we've got a little bit of both happening in Q4. But yes, is it possible for Hopper to grow between Q3 and Q4, it's possible, but we'll just have to see."

On the back of this, we've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the roadmap you presented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the transition to [Ruben] (ph) in 2026. Can you sort of speak to that? And some investors are questioning that. So if you can sort of speak to your ability to execute on time, that would be super helpful. And then a quick part B, on supply constraints, is it a multitude of componentry that's causing this? Or is it specifically [HBM] (ph)? Is it supply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they worsening? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful as well. Thank you."

And if I look at the increase in your purchase commitments and your supply obligations, that's also quite bullish. On the other hand, there's some school of thought that not that many customers really seem ready for liquid cooling and I do recognize that some of these racks can be air-cooled. And I know that some of these racks can be air-cooled. But Jensen, is that something to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp? And then I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year and you look into '26, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power, supply-chain or at some point, models start to get smaller? I'm just wondering if you could speak to that? Thanks."

        "Thanks for taking my question. Colette, just to clarify, do you think it's a fair assumption to think NVIDIA could recover to kind of mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar 2025? Just wanted to clarify that. And then, Jensen my main question historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they have inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we get to that phase, or is it just too premature to discuss that because you're just the start of Blackwell? So how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of satisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar 2026? Just how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically, right, the periods of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular hardware deployment?"

        "Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two short questions for Colette. The first, several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4. I guess is that additive? You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half. Does that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well on top of Blackwell adding several billion dollars? And the second question on gross margins, if I have mid-70s for the year, explaining where I want to draw that. If I have 75% for the year, I'd be something like 71% to 72% for Q4 somewhere in that range. Is that the kind of exit rate for gross margins that you're expecting? And how should we think about the drivers of gross margin evolution into next year as Blackwell ramps? And I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory reserves and everything come up."

Do your comments on Blackwell imply that we reaccelerate from there as you get more supply? Just in the first half, it would seem that there would be some catch-ups. So I was wondering how prescriptive you could be there. And then, Jensen, just overall, with the change in administration that's going to take place here in the US and the China situation, have you gotten any sense, or any conversations about tariffs, or anything with regard to your China business? Any sense of what may or may not go on? It's probably too early, but wondering if you had any thoughts there. Thanks so much."

You mentioned also that you had multiple cloud CSP design wins for these large-scale clusters. So I'm curious if you could unpack what's going on in the networking business and where maybe you've seen some constraints and just your confidence in the pace of Spectrum-X progressing to that multiple billions of dollars that you previously had talked about.

And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level typical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem like maybe one of your clients or one of the large models that are out there. Today, how much of the compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pre-training, how much for the reinforcement, and how much into inference today?
